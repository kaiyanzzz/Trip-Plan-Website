# Preferences for Jacki

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Probably easiest by text, but I also try to check my computer often(discord, email, etc.). I am on the east coast, which makes me about 2 hours ahead of you guys time wise, so I may not be super responsive late in the evening but I try to be available during the day.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope to create a project that we are all proud of and hopefully refine our skills as a team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Trying to be more communative when I have a problem or need help. I still struggle with asking for help when I need it and hate confrontation.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Maybe not having as refined skills as my teammates and letting them down. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think you just have to roll with it sometimes. You can only do your best and hope others follow. And remember that grades aren't everything. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Depends on the context, I think if others are willing to help others in order to imporve the project that is okay but completely taking over the project wouldn't be okay. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I think it will probably take around 15 hours maybe more. I'm still a slowish coder/problem solver so it might take my more time to get something done.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think base the decision on skills and what people feel comfortable working on. Let teammates chose first and see how that works out. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If it's the first time, simply talk to them about it to see what went wrong and what we can do as a team to make sure they get their part done.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Try to compromise the best we can, we can't control those around us but I think we could help nudge each other in the right direction if we feel that quality is not up to standard.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Try to be patient with one another as we learn how each of us work and try to organize tasks around each members work habits. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yeah I think that would be helpful for me as I'm fully online. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week maybe more as the project builds on itself.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the situation, If it's a minor change I would probably check with one or two members but if it's soemthing big or something I'm not comfortable with then probably ask everyone.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to move forward in a way that addresses their concerns but also ultimately works for the team. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Come to them nicely and address that it seems they are doing a little too much work and should try delegating those tasks to others.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Reach out to the team to address how I'm feeling and see what their feedback is. I don't mind helping if something comes up and a teammate needs someone to take over something but it is a team project and we gotta split tasks as evenly as we can.

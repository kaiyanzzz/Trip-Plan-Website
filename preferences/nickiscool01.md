1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is best to reach me by text (sms, discord, or canvas). I am on my computer frequently outside of class. I will post my class schedule in the discord.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope we are above average by however we are being evaluated. I would not mind getting an A when the semester is said and done. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I don't have much experience working on a team in school, so I hope to become more skilled in both of those areas. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I suspect one obstacle will be working consistently. When doing assignments alone I tend to work in spurts when working alone, so I will have to make an effort not to do that.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I hope it is everyone's goal on my team to get an A. That is my goal.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If they are motivated to get an A, then I don't see why someone should object.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It is hard to determine at this point. I don't know anything about the project. I assume this class will require more time than most other 3 credit courses. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I suspect we will talk amongst ourselves until one person makes some proposition. At that point the other members will voice any objections and resolve them.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * That would be unfortunate. The rest of the group will have to compensate. If no one else is willing, then I will do as much as I can because I want a good grade.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If my work isn't to someone else's standars, then I will work to improve it. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I can accommodate other people's schedules. I understand everyone is busy. I think everything will work out as long as we are all making constant progress. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I am not oppossed to this idea. I think it might be useful to arrange a time if everyone is willing.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * It is hard to say at this point. I am prepared to meet outside of class however much is neccessary.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * The majority of the team should be on the same page before making decisions
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I like to be accommodating whenever possible, but in this scenario obviously the team will side with the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If it gets to the point where the rest of the team thinks a particular team member is hindering them, then they should take that up with the instructor. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I am particularly excited for this course. I wouldn't mind having too much responsibility.

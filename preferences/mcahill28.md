# Preferences for Mallory

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's probably easiest to reach me by text. I'm pretty much availble most times to respond to a message
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect my team to work together throughout the semester and start assignments early
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I definitely hope to improve my communication skills and be better about asking questions or asking for help from my team when I need it
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I think it will just be hard to be working in a team in general because in other teams I've been in for classes, I feel like we usually decide to divivde and conquer the work, which is very different from what we will be doing in this class.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I'm not sure if anything will happen; I think both grades are acceptable but it would be nice for my team to want an A
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't think so. I think we should all try to be doing an equal amount of work
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Probably at least a few hours for every hour of class time, so at least 9 hours of work per week outside of class
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should talk as a group about each other's strengths and experience to decide who should be working on each part 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I think we should have a meeting to make sure that it won't happen again in the future 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think we should try to compromise and decide on a team standard for our quality of work
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will respect everyone's work habits as long as we meet the due dates and split up our work equally
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it would be beneficial to meet as a team every week outside of class
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Probably once or twice per week depending on the amount of work that needs to be done
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I think we should move forward with the option that the majority agrees on
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will talk to that person and the rest of the team to figure out how to change or split up the team process more equally
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would probably talk to my team and let them know that I need help with the work and responsibilities

# Preferences for Abby

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Voice mail (calling), and texting. After 2pm Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday's, after 3:30 Tuesday's and Thursday's
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Start assignments early, working together, support and encourage one another, and have our grade reflect our hard work.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to improve my response time this semester. I am normally good at responding eventually, however, I could definitely work on prioritizing more important messages over others and responding to them sooner. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Balancing my school work with my extracurricular activities outside of class. Although I am a dedicated and focused student, I could definitely work on improving my team communication and sitting down for a few hours every day working on the project. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Each team member will receive the appropriate grade reflected in their own work submitted for this class. We can focus more so on contributing to the whole group effort than achieving a specific grade.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Not necessarily, I think the work load can be equally distributed across the team where the whole team could receive an A.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I think it will take around an 1-2 hours a weekday to make the project successful so maybe around 7-10, but it really depends on how the team dynamic plays out.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * This could be decided a week into doing the assignments which allows everyone to gage what kind of work suits fellow members the most based off their strengths. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I hope that our team could make up for it in some way. Of course, I personally would not hold it against that person, but rather think of ways we could move forward from it and still meet our objectives for the week.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Those members with different opinions from one another could talk about them and try to resolve them by having a discussion first. I think communication is key for this class.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Coordinating how to work around other team member's work habits will take some getting used to, but I think as long as we each put in individual work regardless of how it is done, I think we can end with a good grade.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Personally, I would prefer that. I tend to get more work done when I am still on campus. However, I don’t mind jumping on discord to have a group call after class.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * From what I speculate the workload to be like, twice a week at most, but once a week could work. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes, although members are always welcome to give me advice or critique my decisions anytime.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * It really depends on the decision being made, but I am willing to hear out everyone's ideas and point of views. We could always find a middle ground between everyone, however if the majority agrees on something the majority will probably outweigh the one. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * First I would discuss this with the team member, and if nothing changes prior to letting them know this, then I think it appropriate that the professor is aware of the situation to help resolve it.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * If it came to the point where I felt overwhelmed, I would vocalize this to my team, and let them know that I could use help. However, I am generally used to heavy work loads, so I am not too concerned if this were to happen as I handle hefty responsibilities fairly well and am not afraid to speak up if it feels overboard.

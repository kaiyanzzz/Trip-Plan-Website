# Team Preferences

On top of communication through slack on a more professional and official basis, we created a text group chat for coordinating meeting times and other informal discussions. 

We all generally aim to receive a good or above average grade reflected in our hard work, team collaboration and distributed work between sprints. We all agree on the importance of working together and starting the work earlier. A few group members hope to improve their ability to work in a team and working on the project as more of a community than an individual effort. We also hope to avoid rushing around before deadlines and not cramming workloads. 

An obstacle that a lot of us see encountering is the amount of skill we possess as individuals' for the benefit of the group, and working consistently  throughout the week and in spurts.
We might not have enough skill, and coordinating when we can meet outside of class. We all hope to work to the best of our ability, which for a lot of us means getting an A. However, we all understand that things happens and we can just roll with whatever the outcome may be.
For us it is no detriment for someone to work harder, as long as it doesn’t impact the work of others' in the group or somebody else's code fragments.

We agree that we will spend more than the time of a 3 credit class (based off the initial implications and impression on the project workload). Another member mentioned working a few hours for every hour spent in class. Generally with any team or project, a discussion is held and then one person comes up with a specific proposition adhering to objections and finally coming to a resolution. This discussion highlights everyone's individual strengths and goals according to the type of work required. 

As long as there is a discussion held about it and it wasn’t anything too detrimental or permanent then it wouldn’t be any consolation to us. Communicating individual ideas among everyone in the group is essential, and we all understand the importance of being honest and talking it through with each other. While remaining accommodating to everyone's work habits, we hope to communicate over our group chat about meeting times outside of class and if workloads call for more meetings.

We all agree that it would be useful to have a standing meeting time outside of class, which we have already coordinated to convene immediately after lecture. Depending on the urgency and amount of tasks, we will dedicate more than one meeting time per week. However, we generally agree on meeting once. 

When it comes down to individual work, decisions don’t need to be approved. Regarding group efforts and decisions being made for submissions, we all agree that we should have approval from all team members to keep everyone's ideas and opinions in mind. We all think that wherever the majority of the group is leaning towards, that will probably outweigh the one. 
If a dominating team member ever gets to the point of impacting the group dynamic and work, then we will bring it up with the instructor. Since a lot of us are excited for this course, we are willing to uphold our individual responsibilities for the project. We all agree on the importance of dividing the work and distributing equally across the group.

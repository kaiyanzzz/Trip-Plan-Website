# Sprint 4 - *4* - *Geek Velocity*

## Goal
### *Shorter tours!*

## Sprint Leader: 
### *Nick Hinderer*

## Definition of Done

* The Increment release for `v4.x` created as a GitHub Release and deployed on black-bottle under SPRINT.
* The design document (`design.md`) is updated.
* The sprint document (`sprint.md`) is updated with scrums, completed metrics, review, and retrospective.

## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A (technical debt ratio==0).
* Minimize code smells and duplication.
* Use Single Responsibility Principle.

### Test Driven Development
* Write the tests before the code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is 70%

### Processes
* Incremental development.  No big bangs.
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
* Shorter Trip - The first epic we plan on completing is the shorter trip epic. The application will allow the user to be able to check and see if a shorter route exists for an existing trip. If a shorter route exists for an existing trip, the route will be displayed on the map, and the user will be prompted to select whether they want to use the new route or retain the original. The calculation for the shorter trip route should take less than a second.

* Save Trip - The second epic we plan on completing is the save trip epic. We will be adding a feature that allows the user to be able to use the application to save an existing trip to a file locally to their machine so that it can be pulled up at a later time during another session and all the information from the current trip will be reloaded into the new session. The saved trip file will be in a format which can be loaded into different applications like excel or google sheets. 

* User Experience - The third epic we plan on completing is the user experience epic. Each member of our team will ask someone from outside the course (not including people who have already taken the course) to use the app and provide feedback and pointers on areas we can work on to improve overall user experience. We will document the feedback and implement the specific points we get as tasks to work on during sprint 4. Areas we will improve may include, but are not limited to, removing clutter, simplifying user interface, progressive disclosure, minimizing scrolling, and adding necessary icons and labels.

# Sprint 4 - *4* - *Geek Velocity*

## Goal
### *Shorter tours!*

## Sprint Leader: 
### *Nick Hinderer*

## Definition of Done

* The Increment release for `v4.x` created as a GitHub Release and deployed on black-bottle under SPRINT.
* The design document (`design.md`) is updated.
* The sprint document (`sprint.md`) is updated with scrums, completed metrics, review, and retrospective.

## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A (technical debt ratio==0).
* Minimize code smells and duplication.
* Use Single Responsibility Principle.

### Test Driven Development
* Write the tests before the code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is 70%

### Processes
* Incremental development.  No big bangs.
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
* Shorter Trip - The first epic we plan on completing is the shorter trip epic. The application will allow the user to be able to check and see if a shorter route exists for an existing trip. If a shorter route exists for an existing trip, the route will be displayed on the map, and the user will be prompted to select whether they want to use the new route or retain the original. The calculation for the shorter trip route should take less than a second.

* Save Trip - The second epic we plan on completing is the save trip epic. We will be adding a feature that allows the user to be able to use the application to save an existing trip to a file locally to their machine so that it can be pulled up at a later time during another session and all the information from the current trip will be reloaded into the new session. The saved trip file will be in a format which can be loaded into different applications like excel or google sheets. 

* User Experience - The third epic we plan on completing is the user experience epic. Each member of our team will ask someone from outside the course (not including people who have already taken the course) to use the app and provide feedback and pointers on areas we can work on to improve overall user experience. We will document the feedback and implement the specific points we get as tasks to work on during sprint 4. Areas we will improve may include, but are not limited to, removing clutter, simplifying user interface, progressive disclosure, minimizing scrolling, and adding necessary icons and labels.

## Review

### Epics completed  
We finished the nearest-neighbor optimization of the shorter trip epic. We also finished the save trip epic. The user is able to save their trip as a JSON file. Also, we finished the user feedback portion of the UX epic.

### Epics not completed 
We finished all the epics we planned at the beginning of the sprint.

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
Our team did a good job of working incrementally. We did a good job of making a realistic estimation of the amount of work we would be able to complete considering we got all of our epics done. Our team communicated well with each other. We also got our work started relatively early. Also, as always we did a good job of dividing the work amongst ourselves. Everyone contributed a good amount this sprint

### Things we need to improve
The only thing that comes to mind is that we could have more structured scrum meetings. Our scrum meetings at the beginning of class are typically more casual. If we could have our scrum meetings look more like the ones we have the TA's observe where we all speak sequentially and we concisely say what we are working on, then I think we could be more productive in less time. 

### One thing we will change next time
As I stated previously, we could work on having more formal scrum meetings at the beginning of class. What we did worked, but it couldn't hurt to improve in this area.

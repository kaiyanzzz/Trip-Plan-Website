## Planned Epics

This sprint will have our team focus on the goal of finding places to go. Our team will work towards this goal by taking on two epics, one for finding places to add to the user's trip and the other for highlighting the user's currently selected place. By completing these epics, our team will have fulfilled the goal and updated the functionality of our site.

Our team plans to first complete the epic "Find Places" listed under the product backog. This will entail adding the ability for a user to find places utilizing a string and then add those places to their trip. Adding this ability will involve utilizing the protocol find feature. In addition to this protocol, the team will work hard to ensure that the client can send proper find requests and the server can support such requests. The above tasks mean that the team will need to use progressive disclosure in order to create a pleasing flow of information for the user. Tasks for this epic will be split evenly among the team and all code, including commits, pull requests, and seperate issues, will be compiled together before the end of Sprint 2 in order to ensure proper completion of this epic. 

In addition to completing the above epic, our team also plans to complete the epic "Highlight Place". This epic will entail us working on a way to add functionality that allows a marker to appear when the user selects a place on their trip. Adding this functionality will help with the usability of our site by providing a visual cue when a place is selected by the user. As stated previously, the team will split this epic into tasks that can be spread evenly among the team in order for us to be successful in completing this epic.

## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | *2* | *count* |
| Tasks |  *15*   | *count* | 
| Story Points |  *26*  | *sum* | 

Based on our team's previous performance, taking on the task of two epics and six tasks will be manageable. In the previous sprint our team was able to complete both epics assigned on the product backlog. Our team was not able to complete all tasks previously due to some impediments, but the team is more than capable of taking on the current tasks at hand.

## Planned Epics

  Our team plans to complete the "Team Identification Epic" specified under the Sprint Backlog pipeline. What this entails is the presentation of our identification as developers with our audience being as our application users. More specifically, we will express our team name to the rest of the organization as well as on the browser tab/HTML Title and the application header/footer. Roles within the group will also take form as the group work will be distributed accordingly among the team. As a result, all of our pull requests, commits, and separate issues will be compiled together by the end of Sprint 1 as finished work towards our  team's application.
  
  Similarly, our team will complete the designated "About" epic. Our user's want to know more about who we are as developer's. This plays a significant role in the Sprint because it factors into whether or not user's will choose our product or not. To accomplish this, we plan to provide the user with information as follows: an image and mission statement of the team; an individual image, name, and short biography for each member of the team; a maintained and consistent style, format, and voice throughout all content; and finally progressive disclosure to reduce screen clutter. We plan to utlitize this epic as practice for writing any sort of biography in our future as both students and soon to be software engineers.

## Scrums

This allows us to track our progress on tasks during the scrum.
The #*task* numbers refer to the issue numbers in GitHub.

## Review

### Epics completed
After distributing the tasks accordingly, our group was able to finish Epic #13 Team Identification. We were able to have one each member work on the various forms of identification within the website on either the server, client, or browser side. We also completed Epic #22 About with our personal photos, short bios, and home town while also maintaining mobile compatibility. 

### Epics not completed
### Things we did well (regarding the product)
Our group did a good job of distributing the work evenly. We were able to immediately start our individual assigned tasks and come together at the end of the day with our commits and pushes to main. All pull requests were accounted for and merged in a timely fashion. 

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
Our group did a good job of communicating with each other on what each of us were doing for the epics under the Sprint Backlog pipeline. Clarity was definitely a strength within our group for Sprint1. Kaiyan was especially helpful in ensuring everyone was in a good starting point to begin work on the epics and was also keeping us up to speed with our designated tasks.

### Things that we need to improve 
I think we could have done better with coordinating a time to call Jacki, our online member. We always want to make sure everyone is included in the work distribution, so we could definitely improve our clarity with her and checking in that is kept up to speed just as much as we are. I know for me, I could improve in this area.

#### One thing we will change next time
Next time we hope to allocate time within our schedules to accommodate those of Jacki's. I think flexibility is crucial for teamwork.
